# About Me
I am Rikiya Takehi, a 3rd-year undergraduate student in [Sakai Lab.](http://sakailab.com/english/) of Waseda University, supervised by [Prof. Tetsuya Sakai](http://sakailab.com/tetsuya/).ã€€Currently, I am a guest researcher at [NIST](nist.gov), supervised by [Prof. Ian Soboroff](https://www.nist.gov/people/ian-soboroff), conducting research broadly on IR. I am also supervised by [Yuta Saito](https://usait0.com/en/) of Cornell Unv, working on counterfactual learning and fairness in rankings. My research interest widely orbits around information retrieval and machine learning, including evaluation, fairness, search, recommendation and rankings.
