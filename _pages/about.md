# About Me
I am Rikiya Takehi, a third-year undergraduate student in [Sakai Lab.](http://sakailab.com/english/) of Waseda University, supervised by [Prof. Tetsuya Sakai](http://sakailab.com/tetsuya/). <br> Previously, I was doing research at [NIST](nist.gov) in the US as a guest researcher, working with [Dr. Ian Soboroff](https://www.nist.gov/people/ian-soboroff) and [Dr. Ellen Voorhees](https://www.nist.gov/people/ellen-m-voorhees), conducting research mainly on evaluation.<br> I also collaborate closely with [Yuta Saito](https://usait0.com/en/) of Cornell Univ., working on counterfactual learning and fairness in rankings. 

My research widely orbits around **information retrieval** and **machine learning**, particularly evaluation, fairness and recommendation.
